## Linux CLI and networking

In the process of performing this task I repeated that I've already known about command line and discover how to write bash scripts. Freeform projects helped me strengthen my new skills. I've also learned some new information from course by Hexlet.

Before I started this course, I didn't go into how to work HTTP protocol, so articles was to me a bit complicated to understand.
